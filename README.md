This is a space dedicated to practicing and consolidating my knowledge of Machine Learning using the powerful and versatile Scikit-learn library with Python.

Here you will find a series of examples and implemented solutions for various regression and classification algorithms, ideal for those learning or looking to review key machine learning concepts. The goal is to demonstrate the practical application of these models using sample datasets.

### About this repository:
This repository is the result of following one or more Scikit-learn tutorials. The exercises are designed to cover a range of fundamental algorithms, including:

**Regression Models:**
- Simple Linear Regression: To model the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression: An extension of linear regression to include multiple independent variables.
- Polynomial Regression: To model nonlinear relationships between variables.
- Support Vector Machine (SVR): A robust regression model, especially effective in high-dimensional data.
- Decision Trees for Regression: Models that divide data into branches to predict a continuous value.
- Random Forest for Regression: An ensemble of decision trees that improves robustness and accuracy.   

**Classification Models:**
- Logistic Regression: A fundamental model for binary (and multiclass) classification problems.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN): A nonparametric classification algorithm based on the proximity of data points.
- Decision Trees for Classification: Models that classify data based on a set of rules.
- Random Forest for Classification: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
